<small>ON THE BEACH</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">The Beach
We Came
From</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> WAS standing by the sea-wall,
watching the green water foaming
round the stakes of the breakwater,
when my companion, a
charming and elegant woman,
turned to me:</p>

<p>“What is there in water that
fascinates one?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Do you feel the fascination?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you not know why you feel
it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Because you were once a swimming
reptile.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there is nothing to thank
me for, though the fact is the most
glorious in the universe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>

<p>“The fact that I was once a
reptile?”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>She pondered on this for a moment,
and then:</p>

<p>“I don’t see where the glory
comes in,” said she.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, it is there, for the
fact is the master key to the meaning
of the universe, the one light
that shines in a world of darkness,
and the one sure hope in a world of
doubt.”</p>

<p>“The fact that I was once a
reptile?”</p>

<p>“And I—yes. I would not give
what the webbing between my fingers
tells me for all the promises of
all the religions of all the countries
on earth.”</p>

<p>“Ancestral pride is evidently not
your strong point.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that; but
up to a year ago mental darkness
was my portion. I had no
religion.”</p>

<p>“And have you any now?”</p>

<p>“No, but I have a certainty.”</p>

<p>“Of what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>“Of the fact that the world has
a meaning and life an aim. Shall
we sit down on this seat and talk
for a while, if I am not boring you?—and
may I light a cigarette?”</p>

<p>“You are not boring me—yet.
And if you can prove what you
say, I shall not mind even if you
bore me. But I must tell you,
first of all, that, to me, the world
seems absolutely without a meaning
and life without an aim. I
mean, of course, the general life of
the world, which implies, as far as
I can see, general suffering. If suffering
did people good, then I could
understand that we were placed
here to grow and develop; but
suffering and poverty, as far as I
can see, only stunt and twist and
spoil everything they touch.”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“Then, if you admit that, you
must admit that the meaning and
aim of the world is far from being
glorious.”</p>

<p>“Never. That is what I wish to
disprove.”</p>

<p>“Then disprove it.”<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Growth of
the World</div>

<p><span class="dropcap"><sup><small>“</small></sup>T</span>ELL me,” I said. “Why is
it that an ordinary human
being placed before a flower sees
only a flower and nothing of the
wonder that is in it?”</p>

<p>“Because flowers are so common.”</p>

<p>“More than that—because a
flower is of such slow growth. If
one could see a seed sprouting, a
stalk rising, a bud forming, bursting,
and expanding all in five minutes,
the wonder of the thing would
bring one on one’s knees. The
world is just the same. We do not
see the splendour and magnificence
and meaning of it, because the
growth has been so slow, because
every-day jargon has blinded our
eyes, and scientific jargon has
dulled the poetic perception of the
miracle in its entirety. It is by
looking at bits of the world that
men have come to confusion, instead
of fixing their eyes on the
world from its very beginning.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but who can do that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>“You can, and so can I, and so
can anyone who has studied the
development of the world from the
very beginning.”</p>

<p>“But I have never studied the
development of the world.”</p>

<p>“Well, then it is high time you
began; and to assist you in your
studies, I will give you a vague
sketch of the facts, and when I
have sketched those facts, I will
expound to you in a few words the
deduction which I draw from them
and the reason why I have implicit
faith that earth has a meaning and
life an aim—both equally glorious.</p>

<p>“Now, mind, I have nothing to
do with fancies, only facts. Hard,
dry facts that no one can refuse.”</p>

<p>“First, then, before the beginning
of time there was neither sun,
moon, nor planets; the whole of the
solar system was a zone of incandescent
gas.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>“I know it because all philosophy
points to it, and because in the
depths of space the telescope shews
to me hundreds of solar systems in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
the process of making. Perhaps
you will take my word for the
fact.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Go on.”</p>

<p>“This sea of gas, floating lost in
the universe, was possessed of two
movements: the movement of the
atoms buzzing round each other,
and a movement of rotation by
which the whole sea whirled round
its central point. Millions of years
went by, and during those years
our gaseous sea began to cool and
shrink. But it did not shrink
evenly. The great outer ring of
the sea was left behind, still whirling
and cooling and condensing, but
it did not remain in the form of a
ring. The atoms drew together,
sucked toward a common point
from every part of the ring, and the
result was that a globe began to
form like a great tumour on the
attenuated ring; and as years went
on, the ring gave up more and more
atoms to the globe, till at last there
was nothing left but the globe
whirling along the path once occupied
by the ring. This globe was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the first and outermost planet,
Neptune.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, the sea of gas was
still contracting, and again the
same thing happened. The outermost
edge of the sea was left behind,
in the form of a ring, a globe
was formed and that globe was
Uranus, the second furthest planet
from us. Again the same thing
happened, and Saturn was formed:
and yet again, and Jupiter was
formed: and yet again, and Mars
was left behind in the shape of a
whirling globe of fire, and then the
Earth.</p>

<p>“The sea continued contracting,
leaving Venus behind and then
Mercury; and still it continued contracting,
but now it was too small
to throw off any more rings, and it
consolidated to form one great
central globe, the sun.</p>

<p>“The first great act of creation
was accomplished, and on that vast
day when, Mercury left definitely
behind, the budding of worlds was
finished, the sun and the planets
around it might have been seen like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
a golden bee surrounded by its
golden children, shining in the night
of space.</p>

<p>“The earth was a much brighter
place then, for it was simply a
globe of incandescent vapour, and
yet that glowing vapour held everything.
Man and woman, and love
and war, beauty and sorrow. Art,
poetry, music, hunger, and cruelty.</p>

<p>“That mixture of the abstract
and the concrete sounds like rant,
but it is not. It is a bald statement
of facts. Every thought that man
has ever thought, every dream that
man has ever dreamed was lying
unborn yet in the essence of that
globe of incandescent vapour. Every
form that ever sketched itself
on earth was there, too—from the
daisy to the hippopotamus. But as
yet there was nothing definite,
nothing but the dance of the atoms
and the atoms themselves.</p>

<p>“From the first moment of its
separate existence this world <em>in
posse</em>, consisting as yet of incandescent
vapour, began to cool and
shrink, and after the first million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
years or so it began to exhibit the
first symptoms of thought and to
storm at its own shrinking.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me for a moment, but
what do you mean by the first
symptoms of thought?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Germ
of Thought</div>

<p>“The first and only symptom of
thought is action, arising from opposing
forces, and when the world,
now condensed into a liquid form,
began to exhibit tides and storms
of molten matter, it began to exhibit
action arising from opposing
forces; <em>and here let me say that the
amount of work done by the world
before life ever appeared upon it, the
amount of work done by what we call
senseless matter, and the amount of
thought and ingenuity expended on
that work put the much trumpeted
wonder of life in the shade</em>.</p>

<p>“Long, long before the first germ
of life began to form, matter in its
own mind had worked out the problem
of the mountains and the seas;
matter had kneaded the moon in its
‘dull’ hands and flung it up into the
sky to be a lamp and a tide-maker;
matter had worked out the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
problem of lighting and watering
and warming the earth, so that
when life appeared in its first humble
and rudimentary form, it found
a house built for it, water laid on
for it, and all the lighting
arrangements perfect.</p>

<p>“Yes, to me, sometimes, all that
work done by matter on its own
account is even more wonderful
than all the work done by Life, for
even had life never appeared on the
world, the labours of ‘dull matter’
and ‘brute force’ would still have
created the house of the earth.”</p>

<p>“It was created for Life to live
in?”</p>

<p>“I do not think so. I think the
creation of the world was the result
of the first vague struggle of the
spirit of matter toward higher
things. The senseless ferocity of
blazing gas had calmed down, and
the mind of matter, if I may use the
term, had reached the dignity of
expressing itself in form; and you
will mark that the advance toward
higher things was on the road from
ferocity to kindliness; that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
triumph of matter was not so much
in the creation of the forms of hills
and plains and mountains and seas
from whirling oceans of molten
material, as in the creation of those
conditions of mildness necessary for
the existence of life.</p>

<p>“Yes, before life ever appeared,
matter had developed abstract
qualities, the benign had separated itself
from the malignant, and, under
the influence of the benign, Life
first peeped out.</p>

<p>“We date everything from that
first budding of matter into what
we call life. Yet in reality it was
the last stage of a long journey, the
last act of a long series of actions
and reactions, the last triumph of
benignity over ferocity in the first
stage of the evolution of the world.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Benign</div>

<p>“What do you mean by Benignity?”</p>

<p>“I use the word Benignity for
all that makes for development of
the simple into the complex, and
the word Malignity for all that retards
it. I will use the words Good
and Evil if you like them better,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and say that Good in those days
was anything that helped forward
the evolution of matter, Evil anything
that retarded it. The sunray
falling on the first jelly-fish was
good, the storm that injured it was
evil; and Good was good just because
it enabled matter to build one
storey higher, and Evil was evil just
because it tried to pull that storey
down.</p>

<p>“Now you have followed me from
the very beginning of the world to
the first beginnings of life. Have
I impressed you logically with one
simple fact, that the journey of
atoms from a mass of blazing gas
to a world where life was just beginning
to bud was along one path,
and one path only, the path of
development?”</p>

<p>“Of course it was.”</p>

<p>“And of the other fact are you
equally assured?—that the journey
from a whirling lava storm to a solid
world of comparatively quiet seas
and hills and plains and mountains
was a glorious journey and a
benign?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then we will start with matter
on the new journey on which it set
forth a million million years ago,
using for its carriage the first jelly-fish.”<br /><br /><br /></p>

<div class="sidenote">Life
Appears</div>

<p><span class="dropcap"><sup><small>“</small></sup>I</span>T had laboured dimly to form
the hills, the plains, and the
seas, but that part of it which
had laboured to form the seas,
now that they were formed,
found something more to do, found
itself developing in a new and
strange direction—that of life.</p>

<p>“The energy of matter that had
already constructed the solar
system and had evolved the rocks and
the sea found itself at last held up,
cribbed, cabined and confined, with
nothing to do.</p>

<p>“Men ask how did life appear in
the world. For myself, I believe
that life was created by the explosion,
so to speak, of this world energy,
which, bound down by the
limitations it had reached in the
inorganic world, burst the rigid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
bonds of its prison and found a
new field for its labour in the construction
of the higher organic
world.—And, in parenthesis, let me
say that I believe when this same
energy reaches rigid limitations in
the organic world, it will burst
those limits and find its field in a
world as yet unknown.</p>

<p>“However that may be, I propose
to deal only with known facts,
and the surest fact on earth is this,
that when the first vague sketches
of life appeared in the sea, they existed
not by the virtue of chemistry,
nor the virtue of the life that was
in them, but by the virtue of the
steadily working benignity of the
world energy that had constructed
their home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conditions</div>

<p>“To me more wonderful than the
creation of life is the creation of
those external conditions that made
life possible. They collectively
formed the mould in which life was
cast.</p>

<p>“Now, in my sketch of the creation
of the sun and planets I have
just hinted what the brain can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
scarcely guess—the scenes of fiery
storm and horror that preceded the
welding of the world into a solid
whole and the birth of the conditions
that made life possible. But
these are less halting to thought
than the scenes of ferocity that
filled the earth when life awoke,
raging and tempestuous, and form
began to devour form as though
the world energy were eating its
way through all forms to reach the
form of man. And that is, in fact,
the truth. Man has been reached
by teeth just as the hills have
been reached by fire. And not only
man. The dove that was once a
pterodactyl, the dog that was once
a wolf, the cat that was once a
tiger, and a thousand other things
once terrible, thoughtless and ferocious,
all these have come along the
very path that the hills and the seas
came along in their making—the
path from negation and through
ferocity to the benign.</p>

<p>“Now, can you not see why the
fact that I was once a swimming
reptile,—just as you were—devour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>ing
other reptiles, is a fact that I
would not barter for all fancies?
for by its light and by what
astronomy and geology and the other sciences
tell me I can see that the
world, taken as a whole, has a glorious
and definite meaning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
World
Spirit</div>

<p>“And the gist of the meaning is
this: that side by side with the evolution
of world forms, from the
liquid lava wave to the solid rock,
from the rock to the saurian, and
from the saurian to man, has gone
the evolution of world character and
the development of a world spirit;
and that the beauty of kindliness
and benignity and good receives its
deep, deep significance from the
fact that all the labour of the world
since the first cooling of its fires has
been directed along the path
leading to these three gods. Nothing is
more clear than that, and nothing
can be more definitely proved.
There is no use at all in fixing your
eyes on the Jurassic period and saying,
‘What monsters are here!’ or
on a London slum and saying, ‘How
terrible life is! It can have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
meaning!’ There is no use in fixing
your eyes on a thousand years of
history and saying, ‘I see no development.
Men were as good then
as they are now.’ You must take
a billion years in your purview, to
see the amazing and glorious thing
as it is, and then what you will see
will be strangely like the growth
and unfolding of a flower—or the
flowering of a bramble.”<br /><br /><br /></p>

<div class="sidenote">Hard Facts</div>

<p><span class="dropcap"><sup><small>“</small></sup>I</span> BELIEVE in dreams, but I
have no faith except in hard
facts. Those hard facts tell me
that the sun, toward which everything
grows to-day, is the same sun
toward which the seas and the
hills and the rocks grew before life
exhibited itself first, and toward
which life has grown since its birth;
and that sun is the sun of Amelioration,
Benignity, Good, and Gentleness.
Let us call it by the great
good word that embraces all these
things: Good. Well, then, the
world, since the beginning, has
grown toward Good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you deny the soul?”</p>

<p>“I do not. I know nothing about
it. I am quite content to live in a
world that is slowly and steadily
developing in benignity, and to
assist that development in my small
way by trying to develop the benignity
in myself.</p>

<p>“I do not trouble about my soul
one iota, but I am deeply concerned
to keep on that upward path
along which earth is ascending.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Imitation
of Earth</div>

<p>“Ah, but how can one do that?”</p>

<p>“By copying what the earth has
done; by freeing oneself as much
as possible from ferocity, hatred,
lust, and cruelty.”</p>

<p>“But you are neither ferocious
nor cruel?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not actively, but just
as I carry in my material brain the
eye of the extinct monster I once
was, so do I carry in my mind the
remnants of the passions of the reptile
that once was me, the lust of
the reptile and the hatred. I do
not tear other human beings with
my teeth, but I have torn them
by deeds and words. I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
cruel—who has not? lustful—who
has not? inspired by hatred—who
has not? I have regretted these
things—who has not?—and forgotten
them—who has not?”</p>

<p>“But since I have taken a broad
view of the world, since I have seen
that all these things are part and
parcel of the malignity from which
earth is freeing herself in her journey
toward the Benign, I have
come to hate those things as a man
on the road to some brilliant festival
might hate the obstacles on his
path.”</p>

<p>“But since you have no surety
that you possess an individual soul,
you have no surety of ever reaching
the festival.”</p>

<p>“I cannot help that. My immediate
aim is to keep up with the procession.
I leave the rest to chance.”<br /><br /><br /></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Universal
Brain</div>

<p><span class="dropcap"><sup><small>“</small></sup>A</span>LL that,” said she, “seems
true. No one can deny that
the world has developed; no one
can deny that the world has developed
along the path that leads to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
gentleness and good. The world is
like a big head, isn’t it? With all
its brains on the outside.”</p>

<p>“Just. It began to think like a
jelly-fish; then it went on to the
consciousness of the first reptile;
then it went on till it thought like
an animal, and finished by thinking
like a man. The world, as you say,
is a big head, with its brains on the
outside. But during the last hundred
years an astounding development
has taken place in the world
of ethics. Philosophically speaking
now, there is no such thing as an
individual brain; every brain in
the western world is only a cell in
the universal brain. And the universal
brain is developing on lines
of its own, and in precisely the
same way as the individual brain
developed.</p>

<p>“A hundred—or shall we say
eighty?—years ago, the brain of the
world consisted of a number of
isolated thought centres. A thought
took six months to reach Australia
from England, and two days to
reach London from Manchester.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Then came railways, the
printing-press, and the electric telegraph;
and in a hundred years the
universal brain has developed from almost
nothing into a highly complex
organism.</p>

<p>“This new power of man to think
universally has not been recognized
by philosophers for what it is. It
is practically the fusion of all brains
into one great brain and the
creation of a new organism. Formerly
there were men in the world—now
there is Man. Roughly speaking,
every brain in the western world
is joining, now, with every other
brain, and the universal brain
thinks as a whole. You remember,
I defined the Benign as that which
assists the elevation of the simple to
the complex, and if, as I fully
believe, all evolution is the child of
the Benign, ought we not to look at
this evolution of the universal brain
with a critical eye, to discover
whether it is following in the same
path as the world followed in its
development from seas of fire to
hills and plains; and as the indi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>vidual
brain followed in its
evolution from the brain of the saurian
to the brain of the civilised man?</p>

<p>“What do we find?</p>

<p>“We find that the development
of the universal brain has followed
in exactly the same path that all
matter has followed from the very
beginning of things. The
development has been extraordinarily rapid
and the stride toward Good has
been mathematically in keeping
with the development. And it is
absolutely truthful to say that
since joining this great confederation
of thought the individual brain
of man has advanced on the road of
ethical progress more in the last
hundred years than in all the
years between the birth of Christ
and the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>“To see what has really
happened, let us look far back over the
civilisations of the world. Egypt
was great, and vanished; Athens
brought art and philosophy and
culture to their highest pitch, and
died; Rome arose, and fell
thundering in ruins into the night of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Middle Ages. For all these civilisations
were in reality segregated
communities, and even in the communities
themselves thought was
not universal. And if you watch
civilisation rising from the mist of
the Middle Ages, you will see that
it rose not by the power of the word
or of precept, but of the printing-press,
the telegraph, and the train—that
is to say, by the universalisation
of thought.</p>

<p>“A hundred years ago men were
still half bogged in the Middle
Ages. Men, compared to what men
are now, were stupid, brutal, and
merciless. Brains there were, and
clever brains, but the universal
brain was not born. The individual
brain has reached its limit of development
as an individual brain and
was preparing for its great development
as a part of the universal
brain.</p>

<p>“What happened was this. From
the printing-press, from the
steam-engine, and from the electric telegraph
station all sorts of threads
began to spin, joining mind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
mind. The minds of Birmingham
became linked up with the minds
of London, those of London with
Paris. The remotest country village
to-day thinks with the greatest
town. A giant of thought has
suddenly arisen in the place of a
thousand pigmies; he has developed
in the short space of eighty or
a hundred years, and his development
has been on the line leading
to Beneficence. And this giant is a
new creation, as important as the
creation of earth from fire, and of
life from earth.</p>

<p>“There have been, in fact, three
creations. The creation of the material
earth; the creation of life,
which reached its ultimate form in
men; and the creation of Man
from the scattered tribes of men.
Man the giant (whose brain extends
to China and Peru, and which will
eventually include China and Peru),
and who feels in the London part of
his brain a pain that exists in the
Congo or Putumayo part of his
brain. Man, who, though a giant,
is still in his infancy and who, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
he has reached his teens, will be a
much more perfect being than he
is now.</p>

<p>“Ah, but will he?”</p>

<p>“Look back at the earth struggling
up from chaos, and always
and always advancing toward the
good; set back now, perhaps, for a
million years by the ferocity of life
fighting for its foothold in the age
of the saurians and the monsters,
breaking past that fearful period
till those terrible forms are utterly
destroyed and there is moulded
from them the kindlier animals,
and, from them, animals more
kindly still; and until among them
are seen the first vague forms of men.</p>

<p>“Then look at these forms of
men, how steadily they have advanced
in perfection and toward
the good. Steadily, I say, though
at times the advance has been set
back for perhaps a thousand years—till
the highest development of
individual man was reached. That
is to say, the highest development
that men could reach toward the
good as individual entities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>“Then what happened? From
purely material causes all these individual
entities have become, or
are becoming, fused into one great
universal entity. The struggle of
the world spirit to higher things
found itself held up by the individual
brain, just as before the
birth of organic life it found itself
held up by the limits of the inorganic
world. It burst that boundary,
and now it has burst the narrow
limit imposed by the individual
mind and has found a new
outlet for its energies in the mind
universal.</p>

<p>“And that mind, though recently
formed, is developing hugely in the
direction of the good. It may receive
set-backs, but even in the
hundred years since its birth, look
at the beneficence displayed in its
working, and look at the effect of
that beneficence on the lives of the
individual men it has taken into
its great keeping.</p>

<p>“Since Man has arisen to take
charge of the world, Justice and
Mercy have marked his dealings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
with men. All things have improved,
and ferocity and injustice
have found themselves under the
sway of a cruel tyrant who is turning
them into the wilderness to
keep company with the tigers and
the remnants of a world that was
once all ferocity and cruelty.</p>

<p>“Since Man has arisen, he has
taken war in his hand; he is weighing
it and finding it wanting. He
has taken superstition and is pulling
its vile wings off. He is taking
the unjust magistrate by his shoulders
and shewing him the door; and
he has put his heel on the tyrant
king. He is freeing the individual
man from the odious idea that the
individual man is made of mud, to
be burnt forever in hell if there is
a flaw in his making. And he has
taught humanity at large that it is
an infamous thing to hang a poor
devil for the theft of a sheep.</p>

<p>“Man is only a hundred years
old, and he has done all that since
his birth.</p>

<p>“The world spirit has been only
a hundred years on this new path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
of development. Can you doubt,
then, seeing its progression during
a billion years, and how it has
spread over ever new fields, that it
will continue so to progress and so
to spread into fields newer still?”</p>

<p>“I can not.”<br /><br /><br /></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Craving for
Truth</div>

<p><span class="dropcap"><sup><small>“</small></sup>Y</span>OU are a philosopher,” she
said.</p>

<p>“No. I am a man who is sick of
philosophy, at least transcendental
philosophy. I want matter under
my feet all the time. Philosophers
make me giddy, swinging like spiders
on threads over abysms of
nothing, and weaving words into
webs to catch—words which they
mistake for thoughts.</p>

<p>“I am sick of religious theories,
doctrines and dogmas, and gods.
I want Truth that a plain man can
understand. I never could understand
the Christian creed as distinct
from the teachings of Christ,
and, what is more, I believe no one
else can. Mahommedanism revolts
me. Buddhism attracts me, yet I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
feel it to be as unfeeding to the
truth-craving part of my nature as
a soap-bubble to a starving man.
Materialism that denies a god revolts
me.”</p>

<p>“But you say you are sick of
gods.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I am more sick of
materialists—all the rest of the religions
are pretty much the same;
they don’t satisfy me. Nothing has
ever satisfied me but the faith I
have struck out for myself and the
philosophy that a little child can
understand.”</p>

<p>“And that faith?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Essential
Goodness
of the
World</div>

<p>“Is simply in the essential
goodness of the world. That is what I
have been driving at all the time
since we began our conversation.”</p>

<p>“But doesn’t Christianity believe
in that?”</p>

<p>“No; Christianity believes in the
essential badness of the world.”</p>

<p>“Of course!—I forgot. All men
are sinners.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it. Christianity believes
that the world is bad to the
core, and yet it believes that a God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Who is all goodness made man
right at once and thoroughly bad;
left him in this condition for an
indefinite time, and then sent His
son down to redeem him.</p>

<p>“Now, I have a great reverence
for other people’s religious beliefs,
but I have a greater reverence for
honest thought, and I cannot—though
I worship Christ—believe
that the world followed that line of
development.”</p>

<p>“You worship Christ, yet you
deny him!”</p>

<p>“No—I worship Christ because
He was entirely lovable. He shines
entirely alone in the world of the
Western peoples, just as Buddha
shines in the world of the Eastern.
He was goodness itself made visible
and audible. I worship all I can
understand of Him. I cannot worship
Him as a mystical figure sent
suddenly to earth to be put to a
cruel death in order that I might
be saved, simply because my brain
cannot understand that process and
proceeding, and I cannot worship
what I cannot understand. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
my defect, perhaps, but that defect
is shared by numerous people.</p>

<p>“And I speak for those people
when I say that faith with us is
impossible unless based on a sure
foundation of reason; that we must
understand before we can worship,
that we do not deny God, but that
we do not <em>see</em> Him, and that if He,
the maker of the world, does exist
as an individual entity, we have
implicit faith that He is the fountain
and origin of all goodness, and
that goodness is His robe; that we
worship goodness and humbly believe
that if He does exist beyond
the ken of our purblind eyes, He
takes our worship of His robe as
homage to Himself far more profound
than homage exacted by fear
or by superstition, and equal to the
homage which great and saintly
souls lay at His feet by virtue,
perhaps, of their truer sight of
Him.</p>

<p>“But we deny, utterly, the essential
badness of man, and our
denial is based on the sure fact that
as man grows in stature, so, <em>pari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
passu</em>, he grows in goodness. We
believe that man, unaided by miracles,
can increase in goodness just
by the virtue of the goodness that
is in life, a seed in the cave man, a
flower in the civilised; we believe
that the printing-press, the telegraph,
and the steam-engine have
produced better ethical result than
all the teaching of the Apostles,
simply because those great fibres
of communication have enabled
men to develop by mutual touch
and the good in each individual
man to rush upward and find a
vast field of new growth in the field
of universal good, a field that shines
now, like a star galaxy above the
hell of darkness of a hundred years
ago.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Left-offs
and
Fissures</div>

<p>“We believe that the minds of
men, like the bodies of men, are
filled with old left-offs and fissures,
and that just as some men are born
with the gills of fishes, through
whose forms their beings once
passed, so some men are born with
the thoughts of the reptiles they
once were, and that the hells of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
priests and the sensuous and painted
heavens, the asceticism that kills
joy, the persecutions and mutilations,
and mummeries and terrors
under which men have groaned for
two thousand years have arisen,
not from Religion, but from old defects
in the mind of man equivalent
to defects in his body, like, for instance,
the vermiform appendix.
These defects have taken the good
food that Christ gave the mind of
man and turned it, not into nourishment,
but into causes of inflammation.
Saurian hatred is bound
up with Religion; superstitions
from the time of the cave men, a
spirit of simian persecution from
the times of the tree men, and lust;
all these vile left-overs clinging to
the mind of the individual man, as
the Pineal eye and vermiform
appendix cling to his body, have
made Religion an impossible food
for the advancement of ethics beyond
a certain point.</p>

<p>“Now mark this. The universal
mind knows not lust; hates persecution;
abhors cruelty, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
preparing to free itself from
superstition.</p>

<p>“How do I prove this? Take the
press of the civilised world, which
is an expression of the universal
mind. Where is the place of lust
there? Where is the place of Cruelty?
Where is the place of Hate?
Where is the place of Tyranny? I
tell you this, that the mind universal
is as far above the mind individual
as the mind of a man is
above the mind of a chimpanzee—in
ethics.</p>

<p>“An ordinary man dare not advance
into the pure world of the
mind universal one half of the
thoughts, nay, one-fourth of the
thoughts that fill his individual
mind. He dare not preach the
hatred that is in him or shew the
lust that is in him, or the spirit of
persecution, or even the spirit of
intolerance; and the restraint upon
him is not so much the fear of the
police, or the fear of public censure,
as a certain recognition in his own
soul of ethical values and an instinctive
horror of putting forth into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
pure light his deformities,—a recognition,
in short, of the essential
goodness of the world. Of course
there are extraordinary men not so
affected—so are there murderers
and thieves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
New
Religion</div>

<p>“Now, I wish to be perfectly
explicit about Religion, or, rather,
about the new Religion which the
world has received from Man. The
new Religion which has advanced
the world more in a hundred years
than all the priest-ridden religions
advanced it since the dawn of
Time.</p>

<p>“Its miraculous qualities arise
from one fundamental fact. It
knows not Individualism.</p>

<p>“It is a simple recognition of
fundamental Rights. It is not the
individual laying down the law for
other individuals (as in the churches);
it is the universe of Man recognising
the laws that brought it into
being, and imposing those laws on
the individual. It does not teach;
it accepts.</p>

<p>“The great teachers of the world
laid down precepts, they formu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>lated
rules of conduct, and their
scholars took precepts and formulæ
and boiled men alive with
them for coining, and hanged men
with them for stealing, and burned
women with them for witchcraft,
and persecuted men with them for
making the sign of the cross—or
not making it, and twisted and bedevilled
those precepts and formulæ
into every shape that an
individual mind could imagine.</p>

<p>“The new Religion does not discard
these precepts.</p>

<p>“Its decalogue, in fact, is longer
and more highly developed in parts
than the old, but it does not preach
its laws, it breathes them and lives
by them.</p>

<p>“More than that: it lives by the
spirit of good, not by the letter.</p>

<p>“The universal mind, for instance,
denounces Theft, yet it recognizes
that theft is a multifaced
thing, some faces being almost innocent,
others hideously cruel. A
hundred years ago, a thief had only
one face, one head, and one neck,
by which he was hanged, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
theft amounted to more than—six-and-eightpence,
was it?</p>

<p>“—So, to come to the end of the
matter, we have evolved a secular
morality that knows no more of
creeds, or threats of future punishments,
or promises of future bliss
than I know of Hindustanee; which
lives above all men, yet touches all
men; which abhors lust and cruelty
and oppression; which teaches the
kindness of Christ to men and of
Buddha to animals, and before
which Atheists and Christians, Jews
and Gentiles all bow. A morality
which, by the influence of the press,
the telegraph, and the steam-engine,
those three Apostles, will spread to
the uttermost depth of China and
to the last temple of that hideous
black blot, India; and which, in the
course of ages, will change the individual
brain of man and raise it
ethically far above its present advanced
position. No; development
has not ceased. Development has
only begun. Give the world a
thousand years more.”</p>

<p>“A thousand years!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>“I do not want to be unduly
optimistical. I foresee set-backs
even in the world of universal
thought. Give it a thousand years
under this new influence, and I foresee
Man, individual man, on the
heights immeasurably above us.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“And then—who knows? The
world spirit that has reached so
many limits, and broken through
them to higher things, will reach
the limit of perfection in man. If
there is a field of perfection beyond,
it will break those limits and
flow on.”</p>

<p>“And if there is no field beyond?”</p>

<p>“Then this whole business would
be as senseless as a farce by M.
Crebillon the younger—whom I
hope you have never read.”</p>

Advance

Material
Lines</div>

<p><span class="dropcap"><sup><small>“</small></sup>I</span> CANNOT deny the truth of
what you have told me,” she
said. “I can see clearly the different
steps up which the world has
come, but does it not seem that
this new universal mind which is
the latest great stage in the advance
of the world has, according to you,
been produced by purely material
causes? It is as much as to say
that the printing-press, the telegraph,
and the steam-engine have
created Good—that they, surely,
never could do?”</p>

<p>“They have not; they have only
circulated thought; they have only
created the platform for thought to
spread on. They have only created
conditions favourable to collective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
thinking. Collective thought, infinitely
more powerful and complex
than individual thought, has worked
purely on the material given to it
by individual brains. It had no
other origin or food. Had that
material been essentially evil, or if
the evil in it had been excessive
in comparison with the good, the
printing-press, the telegraph, and
the steam-engine would have increased
the evil in the world.</p>

<p>“But you have indicated one
point I would like to dwell on. The
absolute essentiality of material objects
and conditions now in the advance
of the ‘spiritual’ and intellectual
world, and the absolute
necessity of discarding dreams and
fallacies. In the last great advance,
Hoe’s machine has done what all the
doctrines could never have done, yet
Hoe’s object was not to construct
a machine for the improvement of
ethics. He was, in his labours, a
materialist, pure and simple; his
object was the improvement of a
machine for the rapid production
of printed stuff. He did not work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
at all in the matter with an eye to
great and abstract improvements.
He just did his little job well and
with all his energy.</p>

<p>“Stephenson, Watt, Wheatstone,—and
ten thousand of others, including
the whole army of Science,
Invention, and Labour—whose
combined work has produced the
Universal Mind, who have, in
fact, created Man, each one of these
had only one object: the extension
of material knowledge and the improvement
of certain material objects
and conditions. They were
not idealists, they were not teachers;
they laboured to produce no doctrines
or airy formulæ. They were
honest workmen in the cause of
material progress, each with his eye
fixed on his job.</p>

<p>“Contrast with these the preachers
and teachers—all excellent, mind
you, and making, in their way, for
good, yet all, by their combined
efforts, useless for the great uplift
that was coming and that could
only come through the work of
Scientific men in the field of Science,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
and Mechanicians in the field of
material improvement.</p>

<p>“And this fact is a perfect lamp
for all who would join in the work
of world development. <em>He who
would assist in the development of the
world must work not in the field of
dreams and theories, but in the field
of matter.</em> That is the doctrine of
the spirit of the world whose great
hands laboured to make the hills
and seas, and flung the moon to the
skies for a lamp and a tide-maker,
who moulded the chimpanzees into
men, and men into civilised men.
Dreams and theories and doctrines,
preachers, transcendental philosophers
and teachers, and even priests—we
want all of them, but they are
by-products. The work of the
world remains the essential thing,
and the pioneers of the world are
the workers, not the dreamers.</p>

<p>“For, though the universal brain
has subordinated the individual, as
the whole organism subordinates
the cell, the universal brain lives,
alone, by the individual, and can
only grow through material means.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
And though the universal brain is
better, infinitely, than the individual,
it can only exercise its power
for good on the individual through
material means.</p>

<p>“That an individual brain may
participate in the life and light of
the brain universal and feed on and
increase with that life, and feed and
increase that life, it must first of
all receive that light and life; and,
secondly, it must be in a condition
to receive it, and this can only be
done by material means. And I
will show you what I mean by an
instance. The man who is crushed
beneath ruinous labour, the man
whose poverty condemns him not
to think, the man who shivers without
a fire, who goes with an empty
stomach—all of that vast crowd of
what we call the Poor—each one of
these is cut off, more or less, from
the mind universal and can never
receive its light except through
material means. Preaching and
teaching, dreams and theories are
useless to these. To participate in
universal thought—which is uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>versal
good—they must first have
the time to think in, they must be
defended from the wolves that prey
on thought, Cold and Hunger; they
must be preached to practically by
the two great Apostles, Wheat-flour
and Firewood; they must be treated
as Hoe treated the dull steel that
made his press—lifted materially.</p>

<p>“Having lifted them thus with
food and firewood, let Education
have its say, and Eugenics, up to a
certain point. But education is as
useless to a work-broken or starving
man as algebra to an ass. Since
Man has awakened to life, he has
begun to recognize this. The old
religions of men looked on the poor
as a necessary evil. “The poor are
always with us.” But man, though
still only a hundred years old, perceives
that the Poor are his disease,
that the criminals are his disease,
and that the idle are his disease.</p>

<p>“The universal mind rejects Poverty
just as it has rejected Hate,
and Lust, and Intolerance; and its
teaching in this respect is, ‘The poor
shall not be always with us.’ That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
is one of the greatest triumphs of
the great good giant born of the
fusion of intelligences; even though,
as yet, the means toward this
great end have not been discovered.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Socialism</div>

<p>“What about Socialism?”</p>

<p>“Socialism, Anarchism, and Syndicalism
are as yet the most obtrusive
results of this universal-mind
disturbance, due to recognition of
the evils that affect the body of
Man. The giant, on opening his
eyes, is furious at his rags and tatters,
and the sores which they disclose.
Man, newly awakened, is
disgusted at his general condition—and
that disgust is at the bottom
of all the ‘revolutionary’ unrest
which we see to-day in the western
world.</p>

<p>“I spoke to you of set-backs.
Should that unrest develop into a
storm, the progress of the world
would receive one of the set-backs
it is well accustomed to.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by a storm?”</p>

<p>“I mean a revolution. An attempt
by sudden and violent means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
to tear up the rags and heal the
ulcers of Man. For instance, were
Socialism in its extreme form to
become the directing power of Man
to-morrow, were every man in the
world to be equalized materially,
the world would be put back on its
path of progress immeasurably.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because the Socialists’ plan is
constructed on a fallacy, and were
it to be followed by Humanity, it
would mean utter disruption of all
social communities.”</p>

<p>“What is the fallacy?”<br /><br /><br /></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Fallacy</div>

<p><span class="dropcap"><sup><small>“</small></sup>T</span>HE fallacy is this: The idea
that the individual is the essential
cell of the community, and
that the energy and life of any community
spring from the individual.
This is not so. The essential cell of
the community is the Family, or,
in other words, the Home, and all
the energy and life of the community
spring from the Home.</p>

<p>“The reason of this is simple.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
The Home is bisexual, the individual
unisexual.</p>

<p>“All the vitality of a community
arises from the interplay of the two
sexes one upon the other, and this
interplay, to be productive of communal
life and good, must take
place in the Home. Individual men
and individual women utterly divorced
from a home of any sort
lose force and deteriorate, and become
warped and dwarfed.</p>

<p>“Sexual force, that is to say, the
force that draws man to woman,
that produces Love and Children,
and love of children, and the love of
children for their parents and for
each other—sexual force, the fiery
grandfather of affection and filial
love, can only be developed as a
force for communal good and individual
good in the Home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Home Is
Everything</div>

<p>“The Home is <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>“It is the foundation of the community,
it is the essential cell of the
world. You cannot injure the community
without injuring the home,
and you cannot injure the home
without injuring the community.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
You cannot improve the condition
of the community radically by pooling
all the money and distributing
it among the homes, or by pooling
all the means of production and
wealth creation and distributing
work tickets to the Home-makers.
Such a distribution of the means of
living would leave utterly untouched
the diseases that prey on the homes
of the nation and would touch with
a killing hand the <em>vitality</em> of the
Home.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its
Construction</div>

<p>“Simply this. Every home is a
tiny nation built exactly on the
plan of the big nation, of which it
forms a unit and which, in fact, is
its counterpart in large.</p>

<p>“The home has its head, just as
the nation has its head. Like the
nation, it is bisexual; it has its
exchequer, its fighting force, its
ethical laws, its ambitions, its alliances,
and its frontiers. It trades
with other homes and combinations
of homes just as the nation
trades with other nations. It has
its imports and its exports. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
its foreign loans and national credit.
It has its internal and external
politics. It has all these, whether
it be a man and wife living in rooms
or a family of twenty, and it is the
facsimile of the nation simply because
the nation is not a differentiation
of it but an aggregation of
it. What is done to the nation is
done to the home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its Power</div>

<p>“A home, or a family, if you like
the term better, is a ganglion of
forces. Love and Pride, Economy
(or the saving instinct) and Ambition,
not to speak of Affection, are
the best of these forces, just as the
best forces in the nation are Love,
Pride, Ambition, not to speak of
Patriotism.</p>

<p>“Inseparably connected with
these fine forces are other most
powerful forces: Greed, Ostentation,
Chauvinism (for a family can
be Chauvinistic as well as a nation),
Love of Domination, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its Death
Blow</div>

<p>“Now, the forcible toeing the
line by <em>each family</em> to a fixed income
and ambition would hit the life of
the home a death blow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>“I will give you one instance.
Ambition would be tom up by the
roots. God only knows all the fine
things that are clinging to the roots
of Ambition. Man knows a few of
them. Fathers of families deny
themselves and work hard that
they may see their sons and daughters
advance in the world; knowing,
as they do, that material advance
is bound up with good
conduct, they look to their own
conduct and the teaching of their
children. Mothers do the same.</p>

<p>“Look at life as you know it,
and tell me frankly, is not this
true? That the destruction of Ambition
in the family would tend
largely to destroy the energy and
life of the family and its power as
a centre of force.”</p>

<p>“It is true.”</p>

<p>“Yet your Advanced Socialist,
with his eyes fixed on what he calls
‘the State,’ does not reckon on this,
and his theory, were it turned to
practice, would destroy Ambition.</p>

<p>“Then, again, Pride, not pride
in high deeds, but pure, low-down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
material pride—how nasty it is, but
what a tremendous force it is!
From the cock that crows to the
State that prospers, it is ubiquitous
as sodium. It is purely human and
animal, yet it is one of the major
forces that hold the family together
and make it living.</p>

<p>“Yet, if Ambition goes, material
Pride must go—absolutely. Then
take the Hoarding Instinct. This
would be absolutely destroyed by
your Advanced Socialist, yet without
the Hoarding Instinct, which,
in a more or less attenuated form,
is the Saving Instinct, family morality
would cut a poor show. Self-denial
would vanish and that demi-virtue,
Carefulness.</p>

<p>“You will notice that I am keeping
entirely to material instincts
and things, and I will rise to the
height of saying that the teaching
of the destruction of the Hoarding
Instinct by Socialists is a blasphemous
teaching, and the blasphemy
is against the Holy Spirit of Good.
I have left the individual for the
family, but the destruction of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
instinct would wreck the individual
as well as the family.</p>

<p>“Ambition, Pride, the Hoarding
Instinct, are not passions; they are
Laws that govern the growth of life,
and they are as immutable as the
laws of gravity.</p>

<p>“Without going further, I shall
content myself with the destruction
of Ambition, Pride, and the
Hoarding Instinct, and leave the
family robbed of them by the Advanced
Socialist—and withered in
its growth. I shall come back to the
point I started from—the Home.
Your Socialist talks of the State.</p>

<p>“I say again—There is absolutely
no such thing. There is only a collection
of homes.</p>

<p>“Behind the word State he hides
his absolute ignorance of fundamentals.
He fancies, as I said before,
that the nation is an aggregation
of individuals, and on that
assumption he concludes that each
individual should be tuned to the
pitch of the mass, so that all
should sing in harmony.</p>

<p>“But the nation in reality is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
an aggregation of individuals at all;
it is an agglutination of Families
or Homes.</p>

<p>“The word State, as implying a
homogeneous and isolated power,
is philosophically meaningless. The
State is not a separate entity from
the Home. It is only, in the administrative
sense, a name for the
common executive which the homes
of the nation have created to conduct
their external affairs individually
as between themselves, and
collectively as between other common
governments or executives.</p>

<p>“When the Advanced Socialist
talks of the welfare of the State he
is talking of the welfare of the
majority of individuals. When he
talks of the State seizing the common
wealth, he means that the
majority of individuals will seize
it and distribute it among themselves
and the minority. He has
absolutely forgotten those separate
hives of sex life, industry, ambition,
antagonism to other hives, and energy,
which are the real units of the
nation, the Families, which are by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
their constituent vices and virtues
the breeding-grounds of all social
energy and virtues.</p>

<p>“And he would advance the
world on its progress by seizing
with the brute force of individuals
dominion over the homes of the
nation. He would allow an executive
created by force to dictate to
each home its foreign and domestic
policy; he would limit its imports
and exports, destroy its ambitions,
plunder its hoard, and make slaves
of its individuals.</p>

<p>“That is Socialism pure and
simple. Arsenic could not be simpler
or purer as a poison to the
common good and the vitality of
any social community.”<br /><br /><br /></p>

<div class="sidenote">Building,

Breaking</div>

<p><span class="dropcap"><sup><small>“</small></sup>A</span>ND you?”</p>

<p>“I would push the world on,
as I said before, by building from
below and by purely material means.
Instead of hitting the family a blow
in its vital part, I would foster its
wellbeing. I would give it drains
and ventilation; I would, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
common fund that all the families
have pooled in the taxes, make
better the houses; I would even
call upon the more prosperous families
to help the poorer, but my one
aim and object would be the protection
of the family in all that
makes for its vitality.</p>

<p>“I would foster family ambition
and the saving and hoarding instinct,
and cooking and household
management and everything that
would keep heads of families by the
hearth instead of talking Syndicalism
in pot-houses and scandal
in clubs. I can not say all I would
do, but broadly I would do everything
possible for material betterment
and everything possible for
the betterment of Family Life.</p>

<p>“And that is what will happen,
Socialism or no Socialism. We began

and seas, saurians, animals, men,

mind.</p>

these fatal flaws in their reasoning,
that does not mean that I am opposed
to all plans for reforming the

would test by everyday logic any
plan for everyday use.</p>

<p>“Will it work? Will it perform
the work for which it was invented
as a kinetic engine?</p>

<p>“Those are the two questions on
which the capitalist satisfies himself
first before he invests his
money in any invention in mechanics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>“Then he asks, will it wear without
undue destruction of parts?</p>

<p>“Then he satisfies himself as to
its economics. Any plan of world
reform which leaves out the Human
Equation is equivalent to an engineering
plan which leaves out of
consideration details like the Law of
the Dead Centre or the Law of Expansion
and contraction of metals.</p>

<p>“If you will examine any great
engineering plan, whether it be the
plan for a bridge or a marine engine,
you will find that it is a simple
bouquet of natural laws, all brought
together by the engineer for a definite
purpose, and every law is
stamped with the + or - stamp of
nature. They are the laws of
weakness and the laws of strength,
and these wonderful laws that preside
over matter so interpenetrate
one another that you cannot divorce
them one from the other.
They may be said to form alloys.
Thus the law that rules over the
breaking strain is at once the law of
strength and weakness. The giant
that lives in water springs into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
steam under the conditions of the
+ law that gives him strength, but
never for a moment does he escape
from the - law of condensation
which is ever ready to reduce him
to water again in a twinkling. And
so on.</p>

<p>“Now, the task of the engineer
is <em>not</em> to eliminate the - laws from
nature, but to account for them,
and, if possible, to make them, by
a trick of genius, work for him.
The engineer does not attempt to
destroy Inertia, the weakness that
lives in the dead centre of things;
he counteracts the idleness of inertia
by means of the fly-wheel.</p>

<p>“The weakness of Steam under
the law of condensation becomes in
the hands of the engineer the
strength of the steam-engine. The
bursting power of steam, which is
ever at war with the weakness of
the boiler metal, he counteracts by
the safety-valve. He must allow
for everything, or his machine either
will not work or bursts into a
thousand fragments.</p>

<p>“And do you imagine for a mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>ment
that human passions and
energy, strength and weakness, are
less potent than the forces and
weaknesses which the engineer has
to account for in his plan? Do you
fancy that Inertia is confined to
metals, and friction to working
parts of machinery? Do you fancy
that the social engineer, dealing
with powerful and explosive forces,
can plot out a social machine without
taking into consideration the
weaknesses which are complementary
to the forces with which he has
to deal?</p>

<p>“Yet, in all the plans I have
examined, from Socialism to Syndicalism,
not one engineer has submitted
to me a plan in which human
passions and energy, strength and
weakness, are allowed for.</p>

<p>“That is a fact.</p>

<p>“I shall give you just one little
instance, taken from Syndicalism.</p>

<p>“We shall destroy all businesses,
says the Syndicalist, by vexatious
strikes. The capitalist, having vanished
(struck out), the hands will
work the business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Syndicalism</div>

<p>“Just so. But he forgets that all
businesses, like all men, die in time.
Suppose all businesses were
converted into Syndicalist businesses
worked by all the hands, in a
world of Syndicalist businesses—they
would not escape from the law
of decay and death which hangs
over everything material. Businesses
would die, and new businesses
would have to be born under Syndicalism,
just as in our world. The
competition would be just as keen
and the factors of death just as
potent. But the factors of life
would not be as potent. How
would a new business be born to
live under Syndicalism?</p>

<p>“Let us suppose that six men, by
energy, hard work, a little money,
and self-denial (all necessary), found
a small business. It grows and
prospers, and in a year’s time they
find that they must introduce new
labour to cope with the work. But
the new hands are all Syndicalists.
They don’t want wages, they must
have their share in the business.
They are taken on, six of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>“We now have twelve men working
a growing and prospering concern.
Unless they are absolute
fools, they must recognize that
expansion to them means simply
more danger and worry, for expansion
is impossible without more
labour, and all the new labour introduced
only sops up the profits like
a sponge, and even were the profits
to increase out of proportion to the
total labour employed, that increase
of individual profit would in the
majority of businesses be small—in
numerous businesses it would be
non-existent. Why should they
expand and risk what they have
got—for all expansion in business
means risk—simply to benefit potential
labourers?</p>

<p>“The law of Inertia comes at
once into play, without any flywheel
to counterbalance it. The
business ceases to grow, and, a
hundred to one, dies.</p>

<p>“That is only one of the flaws
in the Syndicalist’s design. His
machine has not been constructed
with a view to this and other human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
weakness. In a world of automata
it might work; in a world of flesh
and blood it wouldn’t. In short,
Syndicalism could destroy all the
businesses of the world quite easily,
but it could not build them again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Theories</div>

<p>“Syndicalism, Socialism, Anarchism
cannot stand for a moment
under the eye of analysis without
tumbling to pieces as practical
inventions.</p>

<p>“They seem daring and ingenious,
but they are dishonouring
to virile thought.</p>

<p>“Let us change for a moment and
ask ourselves, not what we would
say to the engineer who disregarded
natural laws, but what would we
say of a playwright who proposed
to present life to us in a play constructed
without a proper view to
human passions, weaknesses, and
fallibility, as well as to human virtue,
altruism, etc.?</p>

<p>“We would say at once: It is
not possible. He may write such
a play, but it would have this fault:
it would represent no society that
ever lived in the world, and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
thousand years hence it would be
as valueless as it is to-day.</p>

<p>“And that is, in fact, what you

humbling himself to the dust, study
the working of that spirit through
the ages.</p>

<p>“He will, unless he is blind, inevitably
see one truth: that this
great spirit has never meddled with
the growth of life and thought, but
has laboured Titanically to prepare
the conditions favourable to that
growth.</p>

<p>“It led life by the fin and claw
till life developed hands and a mind
wherewith to develop its own conditions
favourable to growth. And
all the improvements of the world
since then have followed that law,
the Law of Improvement of Conditions,
not any vague Law for the
Improvement of Life.</p>

<p>“When Life left the trees and
found or dug caves to live in, it left
behind it, as a record of its first
shelter and home and improved condition,
the first vague scratchings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
of Art. You may be sure that
could it have found a record we
would discover also in those caves
some sign of the first glimmer of
Love.</p>

<p>“The cave was the first home of
the germ of civilisation, and the
man who built the first hut laid the
foundations of all the palaces and
cathedrals of earth.</p>

<p>“The man who improved the
condition of the first square yard of
land laid the foundation of all
worldly prosperity, and the man
who made the first hinge of hide
for the first door destroyed a barricade
and laid down the first
condition for hospitality.</p>

<p>“<em>Whenever man has fallen away
from the teaching of this law, he has
always fallen.</em></p>

<p>“Athens rose to the heights of
the Acropolis, but she failed in the
furtherance of those conditions necessary
for the development of the
world—witness her streets. Rome
rose to splendour and fell in ruins
simply because of her failure in the
development of material conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
to feed and foster Progress—witness
her roads—made for armies to
march on. Egypt destroyed herself
with dreams of mysticism and
power useless to the development
of life—witness the Pyramids and
the Sphinx.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Work
of the
Barbarians</div>

<p>“All these so-called civilizations
failed because they were inhuman
in the path of progress.</p>

<p>“They were not developments,
but essays in development. Their
civilizations had no relation to the
broad Human Family, and gave no
platform for that family to develop
on. Athens, Rome, Egypt carried
Arts, Power, Mysticism to the
heights, while down on the plains
the tillers of the soil, the serfs, and
the barbarians carried on Human
Nature.</p>

<p>“Athens, Rome, and Egypt, like
some modern philosophers, took no
account of human weaknesses. Examine
their laws and codes, their
policy, and their view-points, and
you will at once see that their platform
was so narrow that only a
class could stand on it, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
their atmosphere was stifling to
Man. Human nature could not
develop in it. There was no liberty
for growth. Human nature had
reached a certain point; it made
blind attempts to rise higher. It
rose to heights of Egyptian power
and mysticism, and fell; to heights
of Athenian art and philosophy,
and fell; to heights of Roman splendour,
and fell. It was like an animal
trying to leave a sea, and
falling back at each attempt by
reason of the crumbling of the shore
under its weight.</p>

man’s hand that could only find
and cling to that rock. That hand
was Bacon’s. It was so essentially
material and human that it could
distinguish rock from friable sand,
and so powerful that, having found
a hold, it never let go.</p>

<p>“Bacon was the first modern man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
to seize the earth spirit’s law that
development is only possible when
conditions for development have
been already prepared.</p>

<p>“His ‘Fruit’ was another word

Man is to let Man develop, and the

<small>WOMAN IN RELATION TO MAN</small></h2>

<div class="sidenote">No Such
Thing as
Woman</div>

<p><span class="dropcap"><sup><small>“</small></sup>A</span>ND what about woman’s relationship
to the world?”</p>

<p>“There is no such thing as
woman.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!”</p>

<p>“There are only women. To
talk of Woman as a being apart
from man is absurd. When I used
the word Man in talking of the universal
mind, I included women.
The word Man as used to represent
men is a falsity in that it excludes
women. The word Woman is absurd,
however you take it.</p>

<p>“Men and women are cut out of
the same piece of stuff—Human
Nature. The woman is cut a bit
smaller, and her outline is a bit different,
that is all.</p>

<p>“Mentally it is just the same as
physically. She is cut, as a rule,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
a bit smaller, and the outline of her
mind is a bit different. But it is
only a difference in size and outline.
The stuff is the same. And the outline
of the one is complementary to
the outline of the other; where the
woman’s outline sinks in the man’s
sticks out, and <em>vice versa</em>. Mentally
and physically it is the same; they
are, in fact, the two parts of that
great jig-saw puzzle, Humanity.</p>

<p>“The Male and Female are not
a necessity of Life. They are only
a necessity of higher vegetable and
animal life. A large number of
lower organisms propagate unsexually—the
monera, the am[oe]bæ, foraminifera,
radiolara, etc. These increase
either by splitting in two or
putting out buds. The Male and
Female are not, then, a radical
necessity of life, but they are a
radical necessity in development
and in progress from a lower to a
higher form of life. The Male and
Female are not, as I will try to
point out, of the essence of life,
but of the essence of the forms of
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>“We must imagine that the first
germ of life was sexless, a cellular
structure that multiplied by splitting
in two. We must imagine that
because the rigid law of advance
from the simple to the complex imposes
on us the assumption that the
first form of life must have been the
simplest, and the simplest is the
organism that develops by fission.</p>

<p>“There was a tremendous moment,
then, when all earthly life
lived and moved without sign of
sex; cellular forms all alike, all developing
alike, and by the same
method.</p>

<p>“Had all these forms continued
unchanged, the world would now
be just as then. But a change
came, due, we must suppose (from
analogy), not to a change in the
radical nature of these organisms,
but to a change in the external conditions
affecting some of them. The
food environment, or the temperature
environment, or the electrical
environment surrounding some of
these organisms, or some other unknown
but always external influ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>ence,
wrought a change in some of
these lowly forms of life. The
mother of Form—Differentiation—was
the result.</p>

<p>“The organisms affected by Differentiation
had to reproduce themselves
by producing other organisms
in a slightly different form, either
lower than themselves, or on the
same plane as themselves, or higher
than themselves.</p>

<p>“Had they taken the first course,
Differentiation would have meant
destruction and death to all the organisms
it touched. The second
course was absolutely impossible.
A simple organism cannot alter itself
without ascending or descending;
if it becomes the least degree
more complex, it ascends; if it
becomes the least degree less complex,
it descends. It cannot alter
its nature or its form in a horizontal
direction. It is absolutely condemned
to the vertical, and must
go up or down.</p>

<p>“These basic simple organisms,
then, that formed the foundation
for all life, must have responded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
their change in environment by ascending,
that is, by becoming more
complex. They must have done
this, or else have descended to
death. They were making for the
great goal, Sex.</p>

<p>“How they reached that goal
may be a story yet to be read by
Science, but reach it they did on
the day that two of these simple-minded
organisms reproduced themselves,
not by individual fission, but
by mutual union.</p>

<p>“It was not a radical change in
the life of the organisms; it was
only a radical change in the method
by which that life was reproduced.</p>

<p>“It was a change in business
methods. It was co-operation, pure
and simple, between two organisms
in the production of other organisms.
Before that day, the whole
business had to be done by one individual;
after that day it was
done by partners, one called Male,
the other Female.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sex a
Partnership</div>

<p>“Now, what is the essence of
partnership? Mutual assistance.
In a labour partnership where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
business is in the least complex,
two men would be of very little
assistance to each other who insisted
always on doing the same
job, or the same part of a job.
There must always be a top sawyer
and a bottom sawyer, a man who
does what the other cannot do, or
gives what the other has not got.</p>

<p>“It is exactly the same in the
business of life-production, and the
instant that Form could demonstrate
them, the two partners appeared,
and the instant that the
new business of Life originated by
this partnership became acute and
competitive, the partners found
themselves leagued together not
only for the production of life, but
for the defence of that life.</p>

<p>“But that carries us beyond my
immediate point, which is that the
terms Male and Female do not
connote separate origins for the
objects they apply to, nor essential
differences between those objects.
The two partners are essentially
the same, only that one has got his
hands horny from doing the rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
jobs of the partnership and the
other has kept her hands soft;
one has developed mammary glands
by doing her business in the partnership,
the other has developed
his biceps in doing his. One has
developed certain attributes of mind
in fighting the world, the other certain
other attributes in keeping the
home. One has developed certain
organs for reproduction, the other—others.”</p>

<p>“Yet you deny the existence of
Woman.”</p>

<p>“Absolutely. But I do not deny
the existence of Sex, always holding
that, though Sex is the most powerful
factor in development, it has
nothing to do with the essence of
life. If it had, you would find men
and women different from one another
in essentials. They are
not.</p>

<p>“As human beings they are exactly
the same, <em>only</em> that you find
some passions and attributes more
developed in men, others more developed
in women. But there is
not a passion or attribute belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
to men that is not shared in by
women, and <em>vice versa</em>.”</p>

<p>“But there is a vast difference
between women and men.”</p>

<p>“Of course there is, but it is only
a difference, not a division; moreover,
it is only a surface difference,
for the deeper you go into their
natures, the less apparent is that
difference. Use the touchstone of
the profound emotions. Who has not
seen a strong man weep like a woman,
or a weak woman show the heroism
of a man? Does sorrow affect
men less than women? Does great
joy affect women more than men?</p>

<p>“Is love a thing apart from man,
and is it woman’s whole existence?
It is not. That claptrap was born
of Fancy, and the passion for saying
a catchy thing. The love of men
for women is just as powerful and
as intimately connected with their
existence as the love of women for
men. Fidelity, the only true sign
of real love, is exhibited by men in
just the same proportion (allowing
for the greater temptations of men)
as it is by women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>“No; men and women are absolutely
the same as human beings in
all things essential, and the man
who denies that is the man who sees
the world with only one eye, and
only uses the surface of his brain.</p>

<p>“Men and women are <em>partners</em>.
Partners in a difficult business.
They have been partners for millions
of years, and the differences
between them are caused by the
exigencies of the partnership.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Men—Women,
and
Women—Men</div>

<p>“Even in those surface mental
differences that mark sex a man
will often approximate to a woman
in some particulars, and a woman
to a man. These surface differences
are not unalterable.</p>

<p>“Take the love of gossip. Listen

<p>“Exactly. And let any one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
would controvert me consider his
friends and relations critically, and
tell me, with his hand on his heart,
are the males destitute of female
attributes and the females of male?</p>

<p>“They are not. They are all
human beings, and to class them
philosophically under the two divisions,
Woman and Man, is a profound
error and a commonplace
error.</p>

<p>“It has led men to look on women
as mysterious beings with essential
motive springs and essential mental
clockwork quite different from that
of men.</p>

<p>“It has led to frightful volumes
of gas being generated in certain
skulls, like the skull, for instance,
of X——, and some of the
leaders of the Feminist movement,
and the escape of this gas is making
an alarming noise.</p>

<p>“When Ellen Key, for instance,
says that ‘Human souls can be
divided into organic and inorganic,’
and that ‘Ibsen makes the masculine
soul inorganic, definitive, finished,
determined; the feminine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
soul, on the other hand, he more
often makes organic, growing in
evolution,’ what does she mean?</p>

<p>“All this loose talk about souls
being organic and inorganic I would
not exchange for one small concrete
fact—such as that Mrs. Jones is a
better man than her husband, or
that John Smith ‘ought to have
been born a girl,’ facts that help
to prove that not only are men’s
and women’s bodies and ‘souls’
made of the same stuff, but that
the sex difference is so unfixed a
quality that we find women who
are to all intents and purposes men,
and men women.</p>

<p>“I will be bold enough to lay
down a law based on experience,
History, and Common-sense.</p>

<p>“There is not a womanly attribute
of either body or soul that has
not been born of the stuff that men
are made of, and there is not an
attribute of women that has not
been developed to its womanly
pitch <em>not</em> by virtue of any mysterious
energy rising from the source
of ‘woman,’ but by purely external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
conditions. And the same with
regard to men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conditions,
Again</div>

<p>“There you have the old ‘conditions’
coming up again. Let us get
at facts.</p>

<p>“The æsthetic sense is pre-eminently
womanly. You will say, at
once, ‘This is not so. Women are
rarely as good artists as men.’ I
was not talking of art, but of the
æsthetic sense.</p>

<p>“Every male artist inherits this
sense from his mother. I am speaking
from long observation and experience.
It is the woman in the
artist that paints; the woman in
the poet that feels; the woman in
the novelist that colours the work.
Every man has the æsthetic sense
more or less developed, but women
have it, <em>as a mass</em>, more developed
than men. Who, for instance,
puts the flowers in the cottager’s
window?</p>

<p>“I do not believe that the æsthetic
sense in the greatest artist
is more developed than it is in
hundreds of thousands of women
who never touch art. His power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
craftsmanship, purely material and
mechanical, and his power of constructive
imagination raise him to
the heights, and these powers only
come from the superior conditions
favourable to them under which
men have dwelt.</p>

<p>“Go into any house, and you can
tell if a woman lives there. Some
delightful trace or touch betrays
the fact. It may be a few flowers—it
may be this or that, but the
æsthetic touch is there; and in the
home it is chiefly the woman who
brings it. Now, why has woman
developed this delightful attribute?
It is a property of the mind; but
men have it, too. Why has she
developed it out of proportion to
the man’s development in this
particular?</p>

<p>“Since she shares it with the
man, it is a common attribute, and
it is the purest common-sense to
believe that she developed it simply
because the conditions affecting her
life were more favourable to its
growth than the conditions affecting
the life of the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>“Though the first scratchings of
art in the cave-men’s dwellings
were, most likely, the work of a
man, who gave him the æsthetic
basis of his artistic sense? Arguing
from what we know—his mother.</p>

<p>“And why did his mother
cultivate this sense more than his
father?</p>

<p>“If you had seen his father tearing
through forests after, and sometimes
in front of, infuriated wild
beasts, while his mother kept cave
and looked after the children, you
would have a complete and pictorial
answer to that question.</p>

<p>“Even the weariness of the chase
is disastrous to the æsthetic sense.
Look at all the hunting men and
women you know, if you doubt
what I say.</p>

<p>“So, then, without any transcendental
talk about ‘souls’ being
organic or inorganic, we may say,
arguing common-sensically, that
women have developed one of the
most distinguishing ‘womanly’ attributes,
not because she is a
woman, but because she is a human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
being, and the conditions under
which she has always lived have
tended toward that development.</p>

<p>“Again—the love of a mother for
her offspring, the one attribute of
all attributes most distinctly and
profoundly ‘womanly’: is it different
in kind or essence from the
love of a father for his offspring?
Surely not, but it is more complex,
more intimate, and more tender
and more lovable, simply because
the conditions under which it has
grown have been more favourable
to the development of this complexity,
intimacy, and tenderness.</p>

<p>“It is the same beautiful thing,
but more peculiarly cultivated, and
it has grown in complexity while
the man has been hunting, or
trading, or fighting the world in
some other way.</p>

<p>“Go through the whole category
of those attributes whose superior
development makes woman the
flower of the earth. You will find
not one which has developed on its
own account owing to some mysterious
chemistry of being peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
to Woman,—all have developed
from the common soil of humanity,
owing to the superior conditions
for their development in women.</p>

<p>“And the chief of those conditions
has been Protection. The old
conditions come up again. The
man when he was hunting and killing
beasts for his wife and children,
and fighting for their existence,
never imagined that he was by his
labours founding Art and Poetry.
He was. He was giving their germs
conditions to grow in. Love, tenderness,
gentleness, affection, morality:
all were there in the cave
with the woman. She suckled
them with her children; she trained
them in their growth with kisses—and
slaps. They were the man’s
no less than the woman’s, common
to both their natures, but he left
them in the cave with her to take
care of, while he went hunting.</p>

<p>“Conditions have made woman
what she is: the best and most
beautiful thing in the world. And
now Feminists want to change
those conditions, just as Socialists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
want to change the conditions affecting
man.</p>

<p>“Those are some of the teachings

Feminism.</p>

<p>“To the first I give an unqualified
assent.</p>

<p>“Freedom, within limits, is the

<p>“But what does the Feminist

<p>“‘She must be free to form her
own ideas and morals.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>“One would fancy from that that
‘woman’ was an animal capable of
evolving ideas and a moral code
different from man. Since woman
is just the same human animal, we
may put this aside, and ask again
what the Feminist means.</p>

<p>“She asks, in fact, that women
may be free to change their morals
(we shall leave the talk about ideas
aside for the present) in any way
they please.</p>

<p>“Now, morals cannot be changed
in a horizontal direction. It’s up,
or down, or stationary. Any change
in morals is for the better or for the
worse.</p>

<p>“Does the Feminist ask for  freedom
to change her morals for the
better? She has perfect freedom to
do that; most men will applaud
her, and most women, too.</p>

<p>“Does she ask for freedom to
change her morals for the worse?</p>

<p>“If she is making that demand,
let her frankly avow that what she
wants is license, not freedom.</p>

<p>“There is a lot of difference between
the two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>“I am not arguing to get the
Feminist in a hole, but simply to
clear the ground of brambles.</p>

<p>“She does want license, as a matter
of fact; one would be blind who
looked at her programme and did
not see that.</p>

<p>“And the license she wants is
not the license to steal, or lie, or
murder, or commit arson. When
she talks of forming her own morals,
she has one morality entirely and
solely in view—the morality that
presides over Love; and when she
asks for license, it is license in
Love.</p>

<p>“Men have more license in this
matter than women. That is undoubtedly
so.</p>

<p>“Men, since the beginning of the
world, have had more license than
women; but that license is a relic
of barbarism. It was useful once,
but it is becoming less useful every
day, and <em>pari passu</em> men are becoming
more moral.”</p>

matter. Their duty was to stay
at home and be moral. Armed and
roaming men fertilised the world,
just as bees fertilise a field of
clover, crossed the races, and made
the vitality of them.</p>

<p>“Roman, Norse, and Norman
virtues that make England great
were born of Roman, Norse, and
Norman license. The same fact
applies to all Europe. But the day
of the free-lance in love is gone.
He who was once a world-maker is
now a world-curse. He is not now
a world-maker, but a Home-wrecker
and a woman-wrecker.</p>

<p>“Nations no longer require him
for a fertiliser. Men no longer
travel in masses, armed with spears;
they go in railway carriages, accompanied
by their families, and the
world can get all the fertilisation
it wants by immigration.</p>

<p>“License still lives among men,
but it lives as a reptile; among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
men it is dying, yet Feminists, when
they ask for license, would give this
dying thing a new birth among
women. They forget that what
was once a bad necessity is now a
hideous and dying superfluity.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Right
of Motherhood</div>

<p><span class="dropcap"><sup><small>“</small></sup>I</span> HAVE heard it stated by
Feminists that motherhood is
the right of every woman.</p>

<p>“So is fatherhood the right of
every man, and on that plea a
man might base a very wide scheme
of immorality.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, there is
something else: the right of the
child.</p>

<p>“A woman has <em>no</em> right to motherhood
unless she can provide a
home for her child. A father has
no right to fatherhood who cannot
do likewise. And by a home I do
not mean shelter and food; I mean
everything sacred that lies in that
word Home. Love, affection, self-restraint,
mutual respect, and family
respect.</p>

<p>“Of course, if the Feminist says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Destroy the home, one has nothing
more to say. She is logical.</p>

<p>“But to say, I shall increase license
among women without injuring
or destroying the home, at once
reduces her to a person who is not
logical.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, the Feminist
movement, as far as its moral
side goes, is confined to a certain
number of men who desire the extension
of license; to a certain
number of women who do likewise;
and to a certain number of women
who feel acutely that women are
put upon by men in the matter of
morals. That men have set up a
rule of conduct for women which
they don’t obey themselves.</p>

<p>“This is not so. The sternest
moralists are women, and the morality
of these moralists is not an
abstract quality; it arises from a
profound and intuitive motherhood
instinct that tells them that license
is death to the welfare of the child,
whether it develops and is shown
in the mother or the child.</p>

<p>“The child must restrain itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
and not steal the jam; the woman
must restrain herself and not let
her honour be stolen.”</p>

<p>“And, you will say, the man
must restrain himself and not steal
her honour?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.</p>

<p>“And every man, who is a man
and not a cur, obeys that law as
far as in him lies.</p>

<p>“Man, you must remember, has
a lot to fight against, and nothing
so much as the old rules of license
under which he has lived for ages.</p>

<p>“They used to be a royal robe;
they are now a beggar’s tatters.
He is ashamed to be seen in them
nowadays; he only puts them on
in private; yet they are always
crying to him to put them on, just
as filth is always crying to a dog,
Roll in me.</p>

<p>“That is all I have to say about
the moral side of the Feminist
people. Their claim for equal freedom
with man in other respects is
far more pleasant to notice. And
it comes to this:</p>

<p>“Since the mass of women is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
just the same as the mass of men,
in the name of Humanity, why
should not the woman mass have
the same freedom in affairs as the
man, politically and socially?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social and
Political</div>

<p>“Why should the women of the
nation not be free to expand their
mental and bodily energy in every
social and political path in which
the men expand it?</p>

<p>“Certainly they ought. But
they can’t.</p>

<p>“They could, in a nation whose
units were individuals; they can’t,
in a nation whose units are homes.</p>

<p>“Every woman is a potential or
actual queen-bee. Her duty is to
found a hive, not to make honey.
Like a man, she has only a limited
quantity of energy.</p>

<p>“The little nation of the hive or
home, which is, in very fact, the
nation itself writ small, makes vast
calls upon the man’s energy and
the woman’s. Here alone is the
national life as distinct from the
national affairs.</p>

<p>“It is the germinal spot and centre
of all national activity; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the primary school of all morality;
and it is the supreme province of
the woman. Here she is a world
Builder.</p>

<p>“This is her kingdom. Her duties
here are not only family, but
national. There are no humble
duties in a home: they are all great
and national duties, directly determining
the advancement of the
world. Like all great duties, they
imply great outputs of energy, self-denial,
and restraint, and it is impossible
for her to use her energies
effectively in two directions. She
cannot be at the hub of the wheel
and the tire both at the same time.
In other words, she cannot be at
home and in parliament or the law
courts, or the council chambers of
the nation, or the studios or dentists’
parlours at one and the same
time.</p>

<p>“‘<cite>Woman must be free to create
her own conduct and to seek her own
experiences for  self-development</cite>,’ runs
another dictum of our Feminist
sage.</p>

<p>“In the home she is only free to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
create her own conduct in a manner
conducive to the well-being of
the home. If she swerves from this
law, she is a defaulter and an enemy
to good. The same may be said of
her freedom in self-development.</p>

<p>“Certainly she must be free to
develop herself, and so must the
man be free to develop himself.</p>

<p>“But the man who develops his
muscles in golf at the expense of
his business time and energy is a
slacker and a defaulter and a home-injurer.
And the woman who develops
her political instincts or her
mind power at the expense of her
home time and energy is the same.”<br /><br /><br /></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
World-Builders</div>

<p><span class="dropcap"><sup><small>“</small></sup>I</span>T seems to me,” said my audience,
“that you look on women
as though they were all married and
with household duties to perform.”</p>

<p>“I look on women as though they
were all married women, or women
preparing to enter that state. No
other women are of any account at
all as world-builders.</p>

<p>“They may be delightful, charm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>ing,
pleasant, true women in every
way, but if they are not married
they are not true women-factors in
the progress of the world. Simply
because they have no hand in the
physical building of the future.</p>

<p>“The child is the future made
visible and concrete. When you
lay your finger on a child you are
touching not flesh only, but future
ages.</p>

<p>“The unmarried woman-genius
may influence the art or the
thought of her time; the labourer’s
wife who produces a bouncing boy
that lives has produced the future.
More than that, she has sent forth
her own attributes to dwell in the
future. More than that, by her
care and education of that child
she is laying the foundation for
vast world effects.</p>

<p>“That is the woman’s triumphant
position in the scheme of
things. She is a partner in world-building,
and the duties lying on
her share of the partnership are
patent and obvious to the meanest
intelligence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>“They are both moral and material,
and they imply in their performance
one supreme virtue: self-sacrifice.
Not freedom to develop
according to inclination; not freedom
to alter her morals; not freedom
to imitate the worst faults of
men; but slavery in the interests
of her children, her husband, and
her home.</p>

<p>“And what happy people these
slaves are! Just as happy as the
men-slaves who, under the dominion
of good conduct, love, and the
hive instinct, often work themselves
to death, like the bees, that
others may live and prosper.</p>

<p>“But, as you say, all women cannot
be mothers. Yet it is essential
that the mothers of the nation
should be protected at all costs
from the disease which lurks under
the specious word ‘Feminism.’”<br /><br /><br /></p>

<h2><small>NOTE TO PART I OF THE BOOK</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> my experience, judging from
the men I have met in life and the
men whose lives I have read about,
the really strong men of the world
have been men of strong belief—and
mostly men with a strong belief
in a personal God.</p>

<p>Faith is a very wonderful thing,
call it what you please. There is in
Faith an enormous dynamic energy
the origin of which, analyse it as
much as I will, leaves me utterly
baffled and bewildered.</p>

<p>One might say that it is an
orientation of the mind, a pointing
of all the thoughts in one definite
direction by which the mind, as a
machine, gains harmony which is
expressed in power of action, and
I believe the co-ordination of the
functions of the mind under a common
governing belief does, in part,
explain the miraculous power conferred
on men by Faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>Also one might say that the
mind capable of great faith is essentially
a positive mind, a direct
mind, and a constructive mind.</p>

<p>Also one might say a great many
things, and yet leave the foundation
of the question as deeply involved
in darkness as ever, and
the mind of a Newman, a Gladstone,
or a Cromwell the same
towering mystery.</p>

<p>But the fact remains clear that
the man without belief in something
above and beyond this world,
or in something <em>in</em> this world, some
tide, or core, or essence of which
his own little life is a part, loses the
alliance of that power which we
indicate in the word Faith.</p>

<p>There is no doubt at all that the
western world has lost power, and
that England is losing power daily
by the steady loss of Faith.</p>

<p>The crude, hard faith in a personal
God which is vanishing from
among us is a dynamic force that
is passing away, and it is being replaced
by what?</p>

<p>It is being replaced by a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
many excellent things: by an increase
of tolerance and sympathy;
an increased consideration for the
oppressed, and a re-valuation of all
the considerations that come under
the title Justice; but all these and
many more good things that have
sprung to growth in the universal
mind leave the individual mind
still lacking Faith.</p>

<p>Darwinism it was that struck the
first real blow at a personal God,
and men, in their minds at least,
have nearly extinguished the chemical
hell.</p>

<p>And Darwinism, destroying the
old rigid, childlike faith, handed the
world not Atheism, but a new
Faith, which the world never seems
to have grasped.</p>

<p>The Faith in a world ever progressing
toward the good.</p>

<p>Once you have grasped the great
truth that your life is a part of this
miracle of growth, as long as you
conform as far as in you lies to the
growth of good in yourself, you will
have a Faith that will fill you with
new force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>And it is a faith that no one can
refuse, for its teaching is written
across the rocks and the stars, and
so plainly that a child can read it,
once it is pointed out to him.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX A</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> HAVE said very little about Anarchism—merely
mentioned it by
name; yet the inquiries I have made
into this subject reveal an organisation
and a literature astonishing
to the everyday mind. To use the
words of that ardent bibliophile,
H. Bourdin:</p>

<p>“To most people the word Anarchy
is evil-sounding, but it is not
the same to learned men and to
collectors and lovers who acquire
the desire of accumulating documents
for history’s sake.</p>

<p>“The Anarchist literature has
not a determined origin, being not
the expression of a system invented
and progressively elaborated, but
the negation of all systems, produced
by the desire to batter down
the despotic in all its forms, the
rules and duty imposed by prejudice
or by force, and to give impulse
to the free development of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>ity.
All acts which have been accomplished
and all words which
have been pronounced in hatred of
this constraint and in favour of this
freedom are consciously or unconsciously
the production of Anarchy.</p>

<p>“It is astonishing when one
glances at the huge quantity of
literature of all kinds which has
been printed in the space of the
last half-century for the exposition
of their ideal thought; no other
party or sect, for whatever cause
they had to defend, can be compared
to this, except Christianity,
which has taken about 2,000 years
over it. Consider the difficulty
which they have met in publishing
clandestinely their periodicals,
broadsides, etc., hunted by society
as wild beasts; domiciliary perquisitions
destroyed their works, which
were merely their thoughts.”</p>

<p>M. Bourdin has courteously allowed
me to inspect the huge library
of Anarchistical literature which he
has collected, consisting of journals,
broadsides, pamphlets, volumes,
songs, theatrical plays, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

journals in the great Bourdin collection.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">*</a>

some of the French journals devoted
to the cause; there are English
and German as well, and there
are sure to be Russian and Spanish
and Italian journals to match.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">*</span></a> This collection is for sale, I believe.</p></div>

<p>It is a big movement. Give me
the literature of a movement, and
I will feel its pulse and tell you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>about its constitution. The literature
of Anarchism tells that it is
very much alive.</p>

<p>What is Anarchism? It is really
unconstructive Socialism and Syndicalism.</p>

<p>The Anarchists want to destroy
society as it is, and let Human Nature
ramp on the remains.</p>

<p>The Socialist wants to destroy
society, and build it again on an
anti-Human-natural plan.</p>

<p>The Syndicalist wants to destroy
the Business World and to erect a
new business world on an unbusinesslike
basis.</p>

<p>Of the three, I prefer Anarchy.</p>

<p>It is the only one of the three
dreams based on common-sense, for
it frankly aims at Anarchy, and
Anarchy is exactly what it would
get were it to succeed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">****</span></p>

<p>I have said “The three dreams,”
and though I have permitted myself
to sneer at some points in the
philosophy of some of these dreamers,
I have no sneers at all to expend
on their energy, and on their whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>heartedness.
They are all trying
to express something, and that
something is the Poverty and the
Misery of the world.</p>

<p>Socialism, Syndicalism, and Anarchism
are all one voice speaking
in different tones.</p>

<p>And that voice is growing and
must be answered, not by Repression,
but by Philosophy.</p>

<p>The world is not all wrong, but
it is not all right. Man is speaking
in no uncertain tones, and he wants
some reply more apposite to his
argument than the glib chirrup of
Pippa.</p>

<small>A PASSAGE FROM HAECKEL<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">*</a></small></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">U</span>NDER the title of <cite>Design
in the Living Organism</cite>, the
famous embryologist, Carl Ernst
Baer, published a work in 1876
which, together with the article on
Darwinism which accompanied it,
proved very acceptable to our opponents,
and is still much quoted in
opposition to evolution. It was a revival
of the old teleological system
under a new name, and we must
devote a line of criticism to it. We
must premise that, though Baer was
a scientist of the highest order, his
original monistic views were gradually
marred by a tinge of mysticism
with the advance of age, and
he eventually became a thorough
dualist. In his profound work on
<cite>The Evolution of Animals</cite> (1828),
which he himself entitled <cite>Observation
and Experiment</cite>, these two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
methods of investigation are equally
applied. By careful observation of
the various phenomena of the development
of the animal ovum,
Baer succeeded in giving the first
consistent presentation of the remarkable
changes which take place
in the growth of the vertebrate
from a simple egg-cell. At the
same time, he endeavoured, by far-seeing
comparison and keen reflection,
to learn the causes of the
transformation, and to reduce them
to general constructive laws. He
expressed the general result of his
research in the following thesis:
“The evolution of the individual is
the story of the growth of individuality
in every respect.” He meant
that “the one great thought that
controls all the different aspects of
animal evolution is the same that
gathered the scattered fragments
of space into spheres, and linked
them into solar systems. This
thought is no other than life itself,
and the words and syllables in
which it finds utterance are the

<p>Baer, however, did not attain to
a deeper knowledge of this great
genetic truth and a clearer insight
into the real efficient causes
of organic evolution, because his
attention was exclusively given to
one-half of evolutionary science,
the science of the evolution of
the individual, embryology, or, in
a wider sense, ontogeny. The
other half, the science of the
evolution of species, phylogeny,
was not yet in existence, although
Lamarck had already pointed out
the way to it in 1809. When
it was established by Darwin
in 1859, the aged Baer was no
longer in a position to appreciate
it; the fruitless struggle which he
led against the theory of selection
clearly proved that he understood
neither its real meaning nor its
philosophic importance. Teleological
and, subsequently, theological
speculations had incapacitated the
aging scientist from appreciating
this greatest reform of biology.
The teleological observations which
he published against it in his <cite>Species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
and Studies</cite>, in his eighty-fourth
year, are mere repetitions of errors
which the teleology of the dualists
has opposed to the mechanical or
monistic system for more than
2,000 years. The “telic” idea,
which, according to Baer, controls
the entire evolution of the animal
from the ovum is only another expression
for the eternal “idea” of
Plato, and the <cite>entelecheia</cite> of his
pupil, Aristotle.</p>

<p>Our modern biogeny gives a
purely physiological explanation of
the facts of embryology, in assigning
the functions of heredity and
adaptation as their causes. The
great biogenetic law, which Baer
failed to appreciate, reveals the intimate
causal connection between
the <em>ontogenesis</em> of the individual and
the <em>phylogenesis</em> of its ancestors;
the former seems to be a recapitulation
of the latter. Nowhere, however,
in the evolution of animals
and plants do we find any trace of
design, but merely the inevitable
outcome of the struggle for existence,
the blind controller, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of the provident God, that affects
the changes of organic forms by a
mutual action of the laws of heredity
and adaptation. And there is
no more trace of “design” in the
embryology of the individual plant,
animal, or man. This <em>ontogeny</em> is
but a brief epitome of <em>phylogeny</em>,
an abbreviated and condensed recapitulation
of it, determined by
the physiological laws of heredity.</p>

<p>Baer ended the preface to his
classical <cite>Evolution of Animals</cite> (1828)
with these words: “The palm will
be awarded to the fortunate scientist
who succeeds in reducing the
constructive forces of the animal
body to the general forces or life-processes
of the entire world. The
tree has not yet been planted
which is to make his cradle.” The
great embryologist erred once more.
That very year, 1828, witnessed
the arrival of Charles Darwin at
Cambridge University (for the purpose
of studying theology!)—the
“fortunate scientist,” who richly
earned the palm thirty years afterward
by his theory of selection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>In the philosophy of history—that
is, in the general reflections
which historians make in the destinies
of nations and the complicated
course of political evolution—there
still prevails the notion of
a “moral order of the universe.”
Historians seek in the vivid drama
of history a leading design, an ideal
purpose, which has ordained one or
other race or State to a special triumph,
and to dominion over the
others. This teleological view of
history has recently become more
strongly contrasted with our monistic
view in proportion as monism
has proved to be the only possible
interpretation of inorganic nature.
Throughout the whole of astronomy,
geology, physics, and chemistry
there is no question to-day of
a “moral order,” or a personal
God, whose “hand hath disposed
all things in wisdom and understanding.”
And the same must be
said of the entire field of biology,
the whole constitution and history
of organic nature, if we set aside
the question of man for the mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>ment.
Darwin has not only proved
by his theory of selection that the
orderly processes in the life and
structure of animals and plants
have arisen by mechanical laws
without any preconceived design,
but he has shown us in the “struggle
for life” the powerful natural
force which has exerted supreme
control over the entire course of
organic evolution for millions of
years. It may be said that the
struggle for life is the “survival of
the fittest,” or the “victory of the
best”; that is only correct when
we regard the strongest as the best
(in a moral sense). Moreover, the
whole history of the organic world
goes to prove that, besides the predominant
advance toward perfection,
there are at all times cases of
retrogression to lower stages. Even
Baer’s notion of “design” has no
moral feature whatever.</p>

<p>Do we find a different state of
things in the history of peoples,
which man, in his anthropocentric
presumption, loves to call “the history
of the world”? Do we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
in every phase of it a lofty moral
principle or a wise ruler guiding
the destinies of nations? There can
be but one answer in the present
advanced stage of natural and
human history: No. The fate of
those branches of the human family,
those nations and races which
have struggled for existence and
progress for thousands of years, is
determined by the same “eternal
laws of iron” as the history of the
whole organic world which has
peopled the earth for millions of
years.</p>

<p>Geologists distinguish three great
epochs in the organic history of the
earth, as far as we can read it in
the monuments of the science of
fossils—the primary, secondary,
and tertiary epochs. According to
a recent calculation, the first occupied
at least 34,000,000, the second
11,000,000, and the third 3,000,000
years. The history of the family
of vertebrates, from which our
own race has sprung, unfolds clearly
before our eyes during this long period.
Three different stages in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
evolution of the vertebrate correspond
to the three epochs: the
<em>fishes</em> characterised the primary
(palæozoic) age, the <em>reptiles</em> the secondary
(mesozoic), and the <em>mammals</em>
the tertiary (cænozoic). Of
the three groups the fishes rank
lowest in organisation, the reptiles
come next, and the mammals take
the highest place. We find, on
nearer examination of the history
of the three classes, that their
various orders and families also
advanced progressively during the
three epochs toward a higher stage
of perfection. May we consider this
progressive development as the outcome
of a conscious design or a
moral order of the universe? Certainly
not. (Certainly yes. Progression
toward the benign is the
core of all morality.—H. de V. S.)
The theory of selection teaches us
that this organic progress, like the
earlier organic differentiation, is an
inevitable consequence of the struggle
for existence. (Struggle for improved
conditions.—H. de V. S.)
Thousands of beautiful and re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>markable
species of animals and
plants have perished during those
48,000,000 years, to give place to
stronger competitors, and the victors
in this struggle for life were
not always the noblest or most perfect
forms in a moral sense. (No,
but they were the best condition-builders.—H.
de V. S.)</p>

<p>It has been just the same with
the history of humanity. The
splendid civilisation of classical antiquity
perished because Christianity,
with its faith in a loving God
and its hope of a better life beyond
the grave, gave a fresh, strong impetus
to the soaring human mind.
The Papal Church quickly degenerated
into a pitiful caricature of
real Christianity, and ruthlessly
scattered the treasures of knowledge
which the Hellenic philosophy
had gathered; it gained the dominion
of the world through the ignorance
of the credulous masses. In
time the Reformation broke the
chains of this mental slavery, and
assisted reason to secure its right
once more. But in the new, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
the older period, the great struggle
for existence went on in its eternal
fluctuation, with no trace of a
moral order.</p>

<p>And it is just as impossible for
the impartial and critical observer
to detect a “wise providence” in
the fate of individual human beings
as a moral order in the history of
peoples. Both are determined with
iron necessity by a mechanical causality
which connects every single
phenomenon with one or more antecedent
causes. Even the ancient
Greeks recognised <em>ananke</em>, the blind
<em>heimarmene</em>, the fate “that rules
gods and men,” as the supreme
principle of the universe. Christianity
replaced it by a conscious
Providence, which is not blind, but
sees, and which governs the world
in patriarchal fashion. The anthropomorphic
character of this
notion, generally closely connected
with belief in a personal God, is
quite obvious. Belief in a “loving
Father,” who unceasingly guides
the destinies of 1,500,000,000 men
on our planet, and is attentive at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
all times to their millions of contradictory
prayers and pious wishes,
is absolutely impossible; that is at
once perceived on laying aside the
coloured spectacles of “faith” and
reflecting rationally on the subject.</p>

<p>As a rule, this belief in Providence
and the tutelage of a “loving
Father” is more intense in the
modern civilised man—just as in
the uncultured savage—when some
good fortune has befallen him: an
escape from peril of life, recovery
from a severe illness, the winning
of the first prize in a lottery, the
birth of a long-delayed child, and
so forth. When, on the other hand,
a misfortune is met with, or an
ardent wish is not fulfilled, “Providence”
is forgotten. The wise
ruler of the world slumbered—or
refused his blessing.</p>

<p>In the extraordinary development
of commerce in the nineteenth
century the number of catastrophes
and accidents has necessarily
increased beyond all imagination;
of that the journal is a daily witness.
Thousands are killed every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
year by shipwreck, railway accidents,
mine accidents, etc. Thousands
slay one another every year in
war, and the preparation for this
wholesale massacre absorbs much
the greater part of the revenue in
the highest civilised nations, the
chief professors of “Christian charity.”
And among these hundreds
of thousands of annual victims of
modern civilisation strong, industrious,
courageous workers predominate.
Yet the talk of a
“moral order” goes on.</p>

<p>Since impartial study of the evolution
of the world teaches us that
there are no definite aim and no
special purpose to be traced in it,
there seems to be no alternative
but to leave everything to “blind
chance.” This reproach has been
made to the transformism of Lamarck
and Darwin, as it has been
to the previous systems of Kant
and Laplace; there are a number
of dualist philosophers who lay
great stress on it. It is, therefore,
worth while to make a brief remark
upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>One group of philosophers affirms,
in accordance with its teleological
conception, that the whole
cosmos is an orderly system, in
which every phenomenon has its
aim and purpose; there is no such
thing as chance. The other group,
holding a mechanical theory, expresses
itself thus: The development
of the universe is a monistic
mechanical process, in which we
discover no aim or purpose whatever
(except that it is ever growing
toward the good.—H. de V. S.):
what we call design in the organic
world is a special result of biological
agencies; neither in the evolution
of the heavenly bodies nor in that
of the crust of our earth do we find
any trace of a controlling purpose
(O blindness! before the wonder of
development.—H. de V. S.)—all is
the result of chance. Each party
is right—according to its definition
of chance. The general law of causality,
taken in conjunction with the
law of substance, teaches us that
every phenomenon has a mechanical
cause; in this sense there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
such thing as chance. Yet it is not
only lawful, but necessary, to retain
the term for the purpose of
expressing the simultaneous occurrence
of two phenomena, which are
not causally related to each other,
but of which each has its own mechanical
cause, independent of that
of the other. Everybody knows
that chance, in this monistic sense,
plays an important part in the life
of man and in the universe at large.
That, however, does not prevent
us from recognising in each “chance”
event, as we do in the evolution of
the entire cosmos, the universal
sovereignty of nature’s supreme
law, <cite>the law of substance</cite>.</p>

<h4>A NOTE ON THE PASSAGE FROM
HAECKEL</h4>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> do not suggest, <em>I affirm</em>, with the
support of all science at my
elbow and all reason at my side,
that the world in its development
has exhibited only one constant
direction, and that direction is
toward what we call the good or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
in other words, progression toward
the complex.</p>

<p>That the development of forms
by natural selection is only a part
of the real business of the universe,
whose mighty labours have, from
the very beginning of earthly things,
been directed toward one distant
ideal.</p>

<p>What is the Ideal? Who knows?
We only know that on the covering
directions of the sealed orders,
which man may not open till he is
fit to read them, are the words:
Advancement, Love, Mercy, Kindliness,
Protection, and every other
word which the mind of man has
marshalled under that mysterious
and general term, The Good.</p>

<p>Blind matter carried those sealed
orders in its body and the first
fishes carried them under their fins,
the first claw was made to catch
them and to carry them through
ferocious times, till the hand of the
first monkey seized them. “Advancement”
was the only word on
the cover then; but, age after age,
hitherto invisible directions began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
to appear letter by letter, till
“Love” stood out, and “Mercy,”
and all those other words that form
the basis of Progress.</p>

<p>Accident and the stress of growth
have sometimes obliterated those
words for years and centuries. Civilisations
have misinterpreted some
of those words and barbarisms have
rubbed them out, schools of Religions
and schools of thought have
meddled with them and altered
them, yet they have always returned,
and not only returned, but
brought other words with them.</p>

<p>The aim and object of life,
Haeckel, are the carriage of those
sealed orders, and the implicit
obedience of the directions that
appear age by age on their envelope,
till, who knows, some day the
word “Open” may be found there,
and some glimpse of the great Ideal
be permitted to the eyes of man.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX C<br /><br />

<small>THE MYSTERY OF ANALOGY AND
SIMILE</small></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>Y companion likened the present-day
world to a big head
with the brains on the outside. The
idea is absolutely just; we have
even the two hemispheres of the
brain in the eastern and western
world. In future years, when telegraphy
and telephony are more
highly developed—and, who knows,
telepathy also—the idea will even
be more true than it is to-day.</p>

<p>In this connection: have you
ever considered the deep mystery
that lies in Analogy?</p>

<p>In the universe of mind and
matter, why do we see the same
idea repeated in widely different
forms. The whole world of structure
is a world of plagiarism. The
skull and a nut are the structural
outcome of the same idea, so are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
the cockle and the almond—but
imitations of structure are nothing
to the fact that root ideas, like that
governing the structure of the
vertebrates, strike upward into the
worlds of thought and action. We
have vertebrates in businesses,
business with brains, spinal cords,
sympathetic nervous systems all
complete. In states, armies, and
more vaguely in philosophies, policies,
and all structures of thought,
whether they be theories, or poems,
or plays, or novels, the vertebrate
idea is found.</p>

<p>Why is the life history of a man
so extraordinarily like the life history
of a nation, and the story of a
man’s day a little poetical simile of
a man’s life?</p>

<p>Why does the poetical simile satisfy
the mind when, for instance,
we talk of a sea that smiles, or
compare a sunset to the fading of
a fortune?</p>

<p>Is it because we have struck,
half-unconsciously, on the key to
the riddle of the universe; that the
conditions upon which the universe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
of mind and matter clings, as snow
clings to branches and twigs, are
exceedingly few—are derived from
the same trunk and strike upward,
through the material and spiritual
world, just as tree branches and
twigs strike upward through denser
and lighter layers of air.</p>

<p>The main trellis or branch conditions
that run through everything
are the conditions of Life,
Death, Growth, and Decay. These
are the four master branches. All
others are the twigs subsidiary and
derived from these. Think, if you
can find a conception of the mind,
exclusive of mathematical concepts,
that does not embody these four
in its essence, and is not, in fact,
the child of these. And yet, these
four are only one. For death is
complementary to life; it is the
absolutely faithful shadow of life.
Nay, it is life itself, for life is perpetual
change, and the essence of
death is not death, but change.</p>

<p>And growth, what is it?—change;
and decay, what is it?—change.</p>

<p>Change, then, is the one master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
idea, the trunk from which all ideas
spring—and what is the soul of
change?—motion.</p>

<p>And what is motion?—it is the
soul of the Universe.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
